As I got to know the family more, I wanted to help spread the word of their mission and with the help of John Summerton and my friends, The Averyettes, we recorded a version of This is Me from The Greatest Showman. This song really resonated with me that it is important to celebrate everyone's unique qualities. That people can be different but not less. This song is played in Aston's school presentations and I am delighted to continue to support Team Avery singing at their events.
