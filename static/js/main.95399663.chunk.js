My name is Jack, and I'm a web designer. I created this site as a \"donation\" of sorts to TeamAveryEssex. I admire Aston and his family greatly and feel this is the least I could do for them. I've taken great care to make sure this site is the best it can be for the team, and I hope you enjoy the site as much as I enjoyed creating it! If you have any questions or suggestions for the site, probably the easiest way to get hold of me is using the site's ",r.a.createElement(B.b,{to:"/contact"},"contact form"),'. Just select the "suggestions" option. I look forward to hearing from you! If you happen to be a fan of my work, why not get in touch with me? You can visit my site ',r.a.createElement("a",{href:"https://www.jaack.dev"},"jaack.dev")," if you'd like!
